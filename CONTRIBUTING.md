# Contributing Guide

Prism is Open Source! Feel free to contribute! 

Here are a few ideas on things you could be working on:

- [ ] generate [flamegraphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html) from the captured profile data.
- [ ] create a sink to send profile data to [statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) or other similar systems.
- [ ] add support for converting profile data into [pprof's format](https://github.com/google/pprof).
